# Calculator task from Frontend mentor challenges

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Testing and developing

During development I used Storybook compose my components.
I also used Storybook for snapshot testing and the Jest library for unit testing.

### Styling

For styling in used styled-components due to it's ability to pass props to the style attributes, and thus making theme-styling easier.

### Context

I used React.Context in order to pass my styling attributes to the components and also for the calculations of the calculator.
