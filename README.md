### My process

## Testing and developing

During development I used Storybook compose my components.
I also used Storybook for snapshot testing and the Jest library for unit testing.

## Styling

For styling I used styled-components due to it's ability to pass props to the style attributes, and thus making theme-styling easier.

## Context

I used ThemeProvider from the styled-components library in order to pass my styling attributes to the components and also for the calculations of the calculator.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles and theming.
